# Steam Sign-up Redesign
This form design was inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtTFEiHFjF4&t=93s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) created by Kevin Powell.

Kevin used Grid to achieve this design -- this was the only hint I had to build it on my own. The CSS is structured with [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), a method that takes advantage of the CSS cascade.
